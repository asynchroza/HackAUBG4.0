What do you understand by ‘Database’?,Database is an organized collection of related data where the data is stored and organized to serve some specific purpose.,database
Define DBMS.,"DBMS stands for Database Management System. It is a collection of application programs which allow the user to organize, restore and retrieve information about data efficiently and as effectively as possible.",database
Define RDBMS.,Relational Database Management System(RDBMS) is based on a relational model of data that is stored in databases in separate tables and they are related to the use of a common column. Data can be accessed easily from the relational database using Structured Query Language (SQL).,database
Enlist the advantages of DBMS.,Data is stored in a structured way and hence redundancy is controlled. Validates the data entered and provide restrictions on unauthorized access to the database. Provides backup and recovery of the data when required. It provides multiple user interfaces.,database
What do you understand by Data Redundancy?,"Duplication of data in the database is known as data redundancy. As a result of data redundancy, duplicated data is present at multiple locations, hence it leads to wastage of the storage space and the integrity of the database is destroyed.",database
What are the various types of relationships in Database? Define them.,"There are 3 types of relationships in Database. One-to-one: One table has a relationship with another table having the similar kind of column. Each primary key relates to only one or no record in the related table. One-to-many: One table has a relationship with another table that has primary and foreign key relations. The primary key table contains only one record that relates to none, one or many records in the related table. Many-to-many: Each record in both the tables can relate to many numbers of records in another table.",database
Explain Normalization and De-Normalization.,Normalization is the process of removing redundant data from the database by splitting the table in a well-defined manner in order to maintain data integrity. This process saves much of the storage space. De-normalization is the process of adding up redundant data on the table in order to speed up the complex queries and thus achieve better performance.,database
What are the different types of Normalization?,Different types of Normalization are. First Normal Form (1NF): A relation is said to be in 1NF only when all the entities of the table contain unique or atomic values. Second Normal Form (2NF): A relation is said to be in 2NF only if it is in 1NF and all the non-key attribute of the table is fully dependent on the primary key. Third Normal Form (3NF): A relation is said to be in 3NF only if it is in 2NF and every non-key attribute of the table is not transitively dependent on the primary key.,database
What is BCNF?,BCNF is the Boyce Code Normal form. It is the higher version of 3Nf which does not have any multiple overlapping candidate keys.,database
What is SQL?,"Structured Query language, SQL is an American National Standard Institute standard programming language that is designed specifically for storing and managing the data in the relational database management system (RDBMS) using all kinds of data operations.",database
How many SQL statements are used? Define them.,"SQL statements are basically divided into three categories, DDL, DML, and DCL. They can be defined as. Data Definition Language (DDL) commands are used to define the structure that holds the data. These commands are auto-committed i.e. changes done by the DDL commands on the database are saved permanently. Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands are used to manipulate the data of the database. These commands are not auto-committed and can be rolled back. Data Control Language (DCL) commands are used to control the visibility of the data in the database like revoke access permission for using data in the database.",database
"Enlist some commands of DDL, DML, and DCL.",Data Definition Language (DDL) commands: CREATE to create a new table or database. ALTER for alteration. TRUNCATE to delete data from the table. DROP to drop a table. RENAME to rename a table. Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands: INSERT to insert a new row. UPDATE to update an existing row. DELETE to delete a row. MERGE for merging two rows or two tables. Data Control Language (DCL) commands: COMMIT to permanently save. ROLLBACK to undo the change. SAVEPOINT to save temporarily.,database
Define DML Compiler.,DML compiler translates DML statements in a query language into a low-level instruction and the generated instruction can be understood by Query Evaluation Engine.,database
What is DDL interpreter?,DDL Interpreter interprets the DDL statements and records the generated statements in the table containing metadata.,database
Enlist the advantages of SQL.,Advantages of SQL are: Simple SQL queries can be used to retrieve a large amount of data from the database very quickly and efficiently. SQL is easy to learn and almost every DBMS supports SQL. It is easier to manage the database using SQL as no large amount of coding is required.,database
"Explain the terms ‘Record’, ‘Field’ and ‘Table’ in terms of database.","Record: Record is a collection of values or fields of a specific entity. For Example, An employee, Salary account, etc. Field: A field refers to an area within a record that is reserved for specific data. For Example, Employee ID. Table: Table is the collection of records of specific types. For Example, the Employee table is a collection of records related to all the employees.",database
What do you understand by Data Independence? What are its two types?,Data Independence refers to the ability to modify the schema definition in one level in such a way that it does not affect the schema definition in the next higher level. The 2 types of Data Independence are: Physical Data Independence: It modifies the schema at the physical level without affecting the schema at the conceptual level. Logical Data Independence: It modifies the schema at the conceptual level without affecting or causing changes in the schema at the view level.,database
Define the relationship between ‘View’ and ‘Data Independence’.,View is a virtual table that does not have its data on its own rather the data is defined from one or more underlying base tables.  Views account for logical data independence as the growth and restructuring of base tables are not reflected in views.,database
What are the advantages and disadvantages of views in the database?,"Advantages of Views: As there is no physical location where the data in the view is stored, it generates output without wasting resources. Data access is restricted as it does not allow commands like insertion, updation, and deletion. Disadvantages of Views: The view becomes irrelevant if we drop a table related to that view. Much memory space is occupied when the view is created for large tables.",database
What do you understand by Functional dependency?,A relation is said to be in functional dependency when one attribute uniquely defines another attribute.,database
When is functional dependency said to be the fully functional dependent?,"To fulfill the criteria of fully functional dependency, the relation must meet the requirement of functional dependency. A functional dependency ‘A’ and ‘B’ are said to be fully functional dependent when removal of any attribute say ‘X’ from ‘A’ means the dependency does not hold anymore.",database
What do you understand by the E-R model?,E-R model is an Entity-Relationship model which defines the conceptual view of the database. The E-R model basically shows the real-world entities and their association/relations. Entities here represent the set of attributes in the database.,database
"Define Entity, Entity type, and Entity set.","Entity can be anything, be it a place, class or object which has an independent existence in the real world. Entity Type represents a set of entities that have similar attributes. Entity Set in the database represents a collection of entities having a particular entity type.",database
Define a Weak Entity set.,Weak Entity set is the one whose primary key comprises its partial key as well as the primary key of its parent entity. This is the case because the entity set may not have sufficient attributes to form a primary key.,database
Explain the terms ‘Attribute’ and ‘Relations’,"Attribute is described as the properties or characteristics of an entity. For Example, Employee ID, Employee Name, Age, etc., can be attributes of the entity Employee. Relation is a two-dimensional table containing a number of rows and columns where every row represents a record of the relation. Here, rows are also known as ‘Tuples’ and columns are known as ‘Attributes’.",database
What are VDL and SDL?,VDL is View Definition Language which represents user views and their mapping to the conceptual schema. SDL is Storage Definition Language which specifies the mapping between two schemas.,database
Define Cursor and its types.,"Cursor is a temporary work area that stores the data, as well as the result set, occurred after manipulation of data retrieved. A cursor can hold only one row at a time. The 2 types of Cursor are: Implicit cursors are declared automatically when DML statements like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE is executed. Explicit cursors have to be declared when SELECT statements that are returning more than one row are executed.",database
What is the Database transaction?,"Sequence of operation performed which changes the consistent state of the database to another is known as the database transaction. After the completion of the transaction, either the successful completion is reflected in the system or the transaction fails and no change is reflected.",database
What is .NET and how does it work?,".NET is a virtual machine that writes, reads and executes strings of code in order to design web applications. Developers compile code for .NET in the coding languages of C# or VB .NET that then translates into other coding languages so the computer can execute it in CLR (Common Language Runtime).",.NET

These services use web protocols and data formats like HTTP, XML and SOAP to access data across platforms and programming languages. The .NET includes a variety of classes that allow for interaction with different web services.",.NET
What is OOP in relation to .NET?,"OOP stands for object-oriented programming, and developers can use it in .NET to create new classes with methods, properties, events and more. It also allows developers to make modular programs that they can use as foundations for new applications. OOPs typically have four common features, which are encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance and abstraction.",.NET
What is the difference between managed and unmanaged code in .NET?,"The .NET framework uses Common Language Runtime  to run strings of code. When a developer writes code in one of .NET's coding languages C# or Visual Basic .NET to then run in CLR, these become managed code. Managed code can run on any platform because it's based in the CLR instead of the computer's operating system. Unmanaged code describes code written in other languages like C or C++. This can mean that developers might have more challenges accessing it across platforms because it doesn't use the CLR to do so.",.NET
When is it best to use .NET Web Forms instead of ASP.NET MVC?,"Many developers use ASP .NET MVC because of its ability to break down applications into discrete models, views and controllers, which makes testing them easy. However, the .NET framework and its Web Forms might be preferable to developers who want to create simple applications rapidly, as using .NET Web Forms doesn't require them to learn new coding or programming languages.",.NET
What is JSON data and how do developers use it in .NET?,JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and allows developers to organize their data in a way that's easy to read. It also lets developers edit JSON feeds on other websites and implement them quickly. JSON helps developers define classes that use elements from JSON text as well.,.NET
What is the Native Image Generator in .NET?,"The Native Image Generator translates the .NET assemblies to machine code for developers to use on a specific processor. This can bypass the constrictions of the JIT, which compiles each method only one time.",.NET
How is .NET different from Laravel?,"Laravel is another framework for development that web developers might be familiar with. .Net and Laravel differ in aspects like the languages they use, the security measures they take and their use of third-party libraries.",.NET

What does CLR stand for in .NET?,"CLR stands for Common Language Runtime. It forms to be the most vital component of .NET as it provides the foundation for many applications to run on. If a user writes an application in C#, it gets compiled and converted to intermediate code. After this, CLR takes up the code and works on it with respect to the following aspects: Memory management, Security protocols, Libraries for loading, Thread management",.NET
What is the meaning of state management in .NET?,"State management, as the name suggests, is used to constantly monitor and maintain the state of objects in the runtime. A web page or a controller is considered to be an object. There are two types of state management: Client-side: It is used to store information on the client’s machine and is formed mostly of reusable and simple objects. Server-side: It stores the information on the server and makes it easier to manage and preserve the information on the server. ",.NET
What is the meaning of LINQ?,"LINQ is the abbreviated form of Language Integrated Query.

What is a compiler?,"A compiler is a computer program that translates written code in one programming language into another language. Typically, compiler refers to a program that translates source code pertaining to a high-level programming language to a lower-level programming language for creating an executable program.",general
Can you please explain the DRY principle?,"DRY stands for Don’t Repeat Yourself. It is a software development principle that aims at reducing the repetition of software patterns. For achieving this, either the repetitive software patterns need to be replaced with abstractions or data normalization must be used.",general
What do you understand by LIFO and FIFO?,"LIFO and FIFO are two of the most popular forms of accessing, retrieving, and storing data. LIFO stands for Last In First Out. This means that in this approach the latest stored data is retrieved the first. This approach is followed in a stack. FIFO stands for First In First Out and is the opposite approach of LIFO. Here, the data that is stored the oldest is the one to be retrieved first. FIFO approach is followed in a queue.",general

What is open-closed principle?,"We are saying we should be able to extend software entities but also close them for modification. It means when you have any new requirement in application or module, we should be able to extend the functionality but also restrict modifying existing entity for it.",general
What is interface segregation principle?,The Interface Segregation Principle states that a client should not be exposed to methods it doesn’t need. Declaring methods in an interface that the client doesn’t need pollutes the interface and leads to a “bulky” or “fat” interface.,general
What is dependency inversion principle?,Dependency inversion principle is one of the principles on which most of the design patterns are build upon. Dependency inversion talks about the coupling between the different classes or modules. It focuses on the approach where the higher classes are not dependent on the lower classes instead depend upon the abstraction of the lower classes. The main motto of the dependency inversion is Any higher classes should always depend upon the abstraction of the class rather than the detail.,general
What is Agile software development? ,"Agile software development is a process that focuses on incremental delivery by the team as a whole. The project is broken up into small chunks that are able to be completed within a given timeframe called ‘sprints.’ In my previous role, we were quite successful in adopting the process. We used two-week sprints and kept high contact with many face-to-face discussions to review questions and concerns as they arose.",general
What activities come under the umbrella activities?,"The activities of the software engineering process framework are complemented by a variety of higher-level activities. Umbrella activities typically apply to the entire software project and help the software team manage and control progress, quality, changes, and risks. Common top activities include Software Project Tracking and Control Risk Management, Software Quality Assurance Technical Review Measurement Software Configuration Management Reusability Management Work Product Preparation and Production, etc.",general
What is Cohesion?,"Cohesion indicates the relative functional capacity of the module. Aggregation modules need to interact less with other sections of other parts of the program to perform a single task. It can be said that only one coagulation module (ideally) needs to be run. Cohesion is a measurement of the functional strength of a module. A module with high cohesion and low coupling is functionally independent of other modules. Here, functional independence means that a cohesive module performs a single operation or function. The coupling means the overall association between the modules. ",general
What is Coupling?,Coupling relies on the information delivered through the interface with the complexity of the interface between the modules in which the reference to the section or module was created. High coupling support Low coupling modules assume that there are virtually no other modules. It is exceptionally relevant when both modules exchange a lot of information. The level of coupling between two modules depends on the complexity of the interface.,general
What is Black box testing?,"The black box test (also known as the conducted test closed box test opaque box test) is centered around software useful prerequisites. In other words, it is possible to guess a set of information conditions that help the program through an attempt to discover and fulfill all the necessities perfectly. There is no choice of black-box testing white box procedures. Maybe it’s a complementary methodology, perhaps the white box method will reveal the errors of other classes. ",general
What is reverse engineering?,"Software Reverse Engineering is a process of recovering the design, requirement specifications, and functions of a product from an analysis of its code. It builds a program database and generates information from this. The purpose of reverse engineering is to facilitate maintenance work by improving the understandability of a system and producing the necessary documents for a legacy system. ",general
What are the elements to be considered in the System Model Construction?,"The type and size of the software, the experience of use for reference to predecessors, difficulty level to obtain users’ needs, development techniques and tools, the situation of the development team, development risks, the software development methods should be kept in mind.
